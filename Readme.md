This is a simple login and signup page and i have also added a home page including some cards which is dynamically inserted, also added a slight version of user and admin login where you need to manually enable the setting to switch between them.
json was used as database for storing user credentials.
sessions and cookies were handled properly.
express.js and node.js frame works were used.

<--------npm install-------->
please do install npm for neccessary dependencies.
